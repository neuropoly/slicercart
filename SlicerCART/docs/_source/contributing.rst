Coding Standards

* Max 80 columns for a single code line
* This project uses the `PEP8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_ convention for naming. Reminder:

  - ``MyClass`` for naming a **Class**
  - ``MY_CONSTANT`` for naming a **CONSTANT**
  - ``my_variable`` for naming a **variable**
  - ``define_my_function()`` for naming a **function** (always start with an action verb)
  - Function definition example (add docstrings for explanations):

    .. code-block:: python

       def my_function(arg1):
           """
           Add such a descriptive comment at the beginning of each function
           in order to explain clearly to the next user what the function does. :)

            Args
                arg1: first argument
            """

  - Use ``TODO:`` for naming **To Dos** in the code
  - Add **one blank line** between each function for clarity
  - **Useful comments** are strongly encouraged
